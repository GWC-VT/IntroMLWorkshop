# IntroMLWorkshop
Follow along with us to create a decision tree regressor in python using Google Colab!

## Instructions for use
We highly recommend using Google Colab for this tutorial. Colab is a free, fully online ID created by Google for editing jupyter notebooks. 
A jupyter notebook is a type of markdown file that allows you to both embed python code and text!

You'll find a few resources in here for your use:

### GWCintroAIML.ipynb
This is the anotated, fully complete document. It includes the example we go over in the workshop, complete with LOTS of notes and extension ideas. 

### BlankFollowAlong.ipynb
This is a blank template that you can use to follow along with the workshop!

2. Click download
3. Go to Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/
4. When prompted to open a notebook, click "upload" and upload the file you just downloaded.
