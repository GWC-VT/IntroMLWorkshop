# IntroMLWorkshop
Follow along with us to create a decision tree regressor in python using Google Colab!

## Instructions for use
We highly recommend using Google Colab for this tutorial. Colab is a free, fully online ID created by Google for editing jupyter notebooks. 
A jupyter notebook is a type of markdown file that allows you to both embed python code and text!

You'll find a few resources in here for your use:

### GWCintroAIML.ipynb
